    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Chimichurri is a dish from Argentina that is usually served over grilled <br>
        chicken or steak. This is my version, which may or may not be authentic.
    </p>

        <li>1 tablespoon red wine vinegar</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 pinch freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>

        <li>½ cup chicken broth</li>
    </ul>
    <!--Steps-->
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                Combine parsley, 2 1/2 tablespoons olive oil, oregano, vinegar, garlic, salt, 
                <br>red pepper flakes, and black pepper in a bowl; mix the chimichurri thoroughly.
            </p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <p>
                Place chicken on a cutting board and remove the backbone using kitchen shears. <br>
                Press down on the breast with the heel of your hand to flatten. Loosen the <br>
                skin of the chicken carefully and rub the chimichurri underneath, distributing <br>
                it evenly. Wrap the chicken in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 24 hours.
            </p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <p>
                Allow chicken to come to room temperature for no more than 1 hour before baking.
            </p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <p>
                Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
            </p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <p>
                Rub 1 teaspoon olive oil over the chicken; season with salt and pepper. <br>
                Place onion in a cast-iron skillet. Pour chicken broth over onion. <br>
                Place seasoned chicken on top.
            </p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <p>
                Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and the juices <br>
                run clear, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the <br>
                thickest part of the meat, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).<br>
                Allow chicken to rest in a warm area for 10 minutes before slicing.
